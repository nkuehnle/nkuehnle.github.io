I recently earned my PhD in biomedical science from Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine and have experience as both a classically-trained molecular biologist and as a bioinformatician/data scientist. I am pursuing career options in data science and/or machine learning that will allow me to apply the skills and knowledge that I have built through 10+ years of experience in biomedical research.

Education and Research Background
======
I completed my undergraduate education at Loyola University Chicago in molecular biology, where I also studied bioinformatics/genomics and completed both computational and molecular research projects. After this, I started a PhD in the Driskill Graduate Program at Northwestern University (NU), an umbrella program in biomedical sciences. In my research I make use of both classic molecular biology approaches and high-throughput, genome-wide technologies. As a PhD student I had the pleasure to receive formal, deep training in several other topics, including: statistics, machine learning, and business management from excellent instructors within NU's computer science, biostatistics, and management programs.

My research background thus is highly multi-disciplinary. As an undergraduate, I even briefly studied as a physics major and completed a short applied research project related to optics and fluid-structure interactions!

For more details on my work, particularly as it relates to data science, see my Resume or Portfolio!

Interests and Hobbies
======
I'm a passionate, lifelong learner and dreamer . My hobbies and interests range from science fiction to fishkeeping (see my PiPy-AWC project for an automated aquarium maintenance device I built using a Raspberry Pi + Python to practice a number of software design patterns). I'm always looking for ways to keep the learning process fresh and expand on my knowledge in a way that's fun and inspiring.
