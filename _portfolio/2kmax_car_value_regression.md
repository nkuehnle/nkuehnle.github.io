## Overview

## Performance

## Access
The full repository with notebooks [can be found on my GitHub repo]https://github.com/nkuehnle/kmax_car_value_regression).

## Data Availability
Data (raw inputs, imputed data, trained models, etc.) are available on my GitHub repo above. The original raw data file is available on [CarMax's GitHub](https://github.com/kmx-analytics-showcase/Winter-2023) and were released as part of their Winter 2023 Analytics Showcase (this modeling was performed after/independently from the showcase competition and seeks to answer a different question).
