A review of the current molecular understanding of KSHV-associated primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and how this might be exploited for therapeutic purposes.

Notably, this included a re-analysis of our lab's 2018 high-throughput CRISPR data in the context of the over 1000 other cancer screening studies (previously ~50 were available) as well as two other virally-associated lymphomas which bear key similarities to PEL.
